# Scenario
Many applications contain a large number of items to display in a Grid. For a small number of items, a Grid can be made using the Row and Column, but it is inefficient. Your task is to use the Lazy Grid component of Jetpack Compose to display a Grid consisting of 1000 items in the Little Lemon app. You will also be required to use the fixed and adaptive grid cells to have different styles. You should also make sure that you follow the best practices while creating it.
